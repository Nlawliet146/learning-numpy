# Learning NumPy

This repository contains my personal NumPy learning files.

The code examples here were written while following the **BroCode NumPy free course** on YouTube.  
I have added my own explanations, comments, and notes to understand each concept better and build a clear reference for myself.

**Purpose of this repo:**
- Document my progress while learning NumPy  
- Store example programs with clean explanations  
- Practice array operations, broadcasting, indexing, and other fundamentals  
- Build a foundation for future Python + AI/data projects  

All comments, explanations, and additional notes are written by me (with some help from ChatGPT for clarity).  
The examples are for learning only and are not exact copies of any tutorial.

Feel free to explore or use these examples for your own learning.
